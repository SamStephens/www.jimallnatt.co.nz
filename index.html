          <h3>Soft cover, 223 p. Out of print.</h3>
          <p>
            This volume is a year-by-year summary of fifty years of Auckland Women's Cricket: supplemented by scores, newspaper reports, team photographs and reminiscences from former players.
          </p>
          <p>
            "On behalf of Auckland Cricket Association I am pleased to support this wonderful book 'Women in Cricket 1928-1980: The Auckland and North Shore Story', which provides a fascinating insight into the
            evolution of cricket in Auckland for women and along with it an understanding of the cultural and societal changes that affected the game across the last century.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Cricket is a sport steeped in tradition, history and most of all statistics. However making the richness of that history relevant to current generations can be a challenging exercise. The creation of a book such as this is a fantastic way to make the stories and characters of women's cricket come alive in a way that a scorecare or match report never will.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Jim Allnatt has done a brilliant job (once again) of researching and writing a book that not only provides a great read but also helps us provide an accessible history of the women's game in Auckland. For that he deserves sincere thanks for all of us who love the game of cricket in this city. It continues his tireless work of recording the history of cricket in Auckland and is a worthy addition to his previous efforts." - Iain Laxon, Chief Executive Office ACA.

          <h3>Soft cover, 339 p. $50 incl. p&amp;p within New Zealand</h3>
          <p>
            This book is the second in the series recording the history of Auckland cricket. As with the first volume it focuses on what was happening in club cricket, how the representative side was doing, and the personalities involved in running cricket. There are many illustrated pen portraits of prominent people spread throughout this history.
          </p>
          <p>
            The photograph on the cover epitomises cricket as it was played in the early twentieth century. It is of the Eden Districts First Grade Xl. The club president is on the left, the scorer is next to him and the secretary is at the other end. There are eight Auckland or ex-Auckland players and four who have played for New Zealand in this photograph.
          </p>
          <p>
            The story of The Middle Years includes: the introduction of the District Scheme for club cricket, which was the cricketers' answer to the poor state of Auckland cricket at the turn of the century; the introduction of the Plunket Shield competition; the development of Eden Park, and the general growth of cricket as the years passed. It is a period of continual change - two world wars, the Spanish Flu and infantile paralysis epidemics, and the Great Recession of the 1930s all occurred within these forty-four years.
          </p>
          <p>
            During this near half century a number of great Auckland cricketers came to the fore, probably as a result of regular provincial cricket and recognition of New Zealand as a test-playing nation. These players are covered in the book, and included are match cards of each match along with a brief report.

            The history was released in 2014 during the NZ – India Test match at Eden Park. People can order a volume by <a href="mailto:jimallnatt@xtra.co.nz">emailing Jim</a>.

            Jim Allnatt, writer of Auckland Cricket: The Victorian Era, says his book traces the earliest evidence of cricket in the region with North Shore part of an initial trio of clubs dating back to 1860. "It’s a definitive history of cricket in Auckland," says Allnatt. "With Grafton and Parnell, North Shore is one of three clubs still playing premier cricket today." - <a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/auckland/local-news/north-shore-times/611031/Doing-write-by-cricketers">"Doing write by cricketers", North Shore Times</a>.

          <p>
            This is the first of the series recording the history of Auckland Cricket. It tells the story of what it was like to be a sportsman in 19th century New Zealand and records every match Auckland played in detail. There are only two copies left.

            A devastating tragedy ignited historian Jim Allnatt’s passion for scouring the cricket archives [...] A desire to protect the club’s history saw Allnatt make a bold proposition to the club’s top brass. "I invited myself down to the re-opening of the new clubrooms, bowled up to the chairman and said I’d like to write the club’s history. I mean we’d already lost it once. I intended to find what I could and put it on a CD and give it to the club. Then they’ve got it forever." - <a href="http://www.pressreader.com/new-zealand/eastern-courier/20150408/281702613230869/TextView">"Historian helps cricket club record its past", Eastern Courier</a>.
